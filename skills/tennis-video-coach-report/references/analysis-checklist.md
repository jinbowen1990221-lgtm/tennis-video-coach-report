# Tennis Video Analysis Checklist

Use this checklist after opening the contact sheets and representative frames.

## Pick Moments First

Select frames in this order:

1. Cover frame: the player looks best and the pose is readable.
2. Ready/preparation: split step, stance, racket location, shoulder turn.
3. Incoming ball/contact setup: spacing, timing, racket face, contact distance.
4. Follow-through: body rotation, balance, recovery.
5. Problem frame: the issue is visible without guessing.
6. Highlight frame: a real positive moment.
7. Early/middle/late contact timestamps: one complete swing from each phase for slow-motion clips.

Do not use an ugly problem frame as the cover unless the user explicitly asks for a diagnostic-only report.

For detailed technique reports, also select a complete stroke sequence with:

- ready/split or waiting position
- first move and unit turn
- footwork/spacing just before contact
- contact window or nearest readable frame
- follow-through
- first recovery step

Do not write kinetic-chain claims from a single still frame unless the claim is purely positional.

## Stroke Type and Player Target

Before coaching, write down internally:

- Which player is being analyzed?
- Which stroke type is most visible: forehand, one-handed backhand, two-handed backhand, volley, serve, overhead, or unknown?
- Is the shot a feed drill, rally, match point, serve practice, or warm-up?
- Is the player beginner/intermediate/advanced based on the user prompt or visible consistency?

If multiple players are visible, identify the target player in the report. If the target is ambiguous, analyze only the player whose stroke is most readable and state that assumption.

## Early / Middle / Late Comparison

Prefer splitting by complete swing count, not by raw video time. First identify all readable complete swings, then divide that swing list into three groups:

- 前段: early swing group. The player may be using the old habit, or still fresh.
- 中段: middle swing group. Look for whether the correction starts to appear.
- 后段: late swing group. Look for fatigue, relaxation, or a new compensation.

Use raw clock thirds only as a fallback when swing candidates are not available. If using that fallback, mark confidence as low or medium-low and avoid strong trend claims.

For each phase, select one full swing that includes preparation, incoming ball/contact, and follow-through. Prefer readable swings over extreme mistakes.

Before writing the comparison, open the freeze frames and ask:

- Does this frame actually show the claim?
- Is the selected timestamp contact, preparation, or follow-through? Do not call it contact if it is follow-through.
- Would a beginner understand what to look at without trusting the text?
- If the text says "准备晚", the frame must show late preparation or the clip must include the late preparation moment.
- If the text says "随挥更自然", the frame/clip must show the follow-through, not only the ready position.

Compare:

- Timing: Is preparation earlier, later, or unchanged?
- Relaxation: Does the swing look smoother or more forced?
- Spacing: Is the player getting too close/far from the ball over time?
- Balance: Does the finish become more stable or more rushed?
- Compensation: Did fixing one problem create another, such as over-rotating, opening too early, or losing footwork?
- Fatigue: Does the late phase show slower feet, lower racket preparation, or a shorter finish?

Write phase comparison as a small story:

- "前段还在靠手找球。"
- "中段开始有转肩，但还不稳定。"
- "后段反而松了一点，随挥更自然；新问题是脚下有点站住。"

Avoid pretending precision if the selected swing is not representative. Say "这段里比较明显的一拍是..." when confidence is limited.

## Annotation Rules

Annotations are evidence, not decoration.

- Draw arrows/circles only when the coordinate points to the exact visual evidence.
- If no precise coordinate has been chosen, use only a phase label and bottom note.
- Keep one annotation idea per freeze frame.
- Bad: circle the center of the court while saying "拍子先回家".
- Good: point to the racket position when saying "拍子还没到右后方".
- Good: point to the finish side when saying "随挥自然过去".

## Beginner Forehand Checks

Prioritize these for ball-machine, mini-court, and self-practice videos:

- Preparation timing: Does the racket go back before the ball arrives?
- Unit turn: Do shoulders and hips turn together, or only the arm moves?
- Spacing: Is the player too close to the ball, reaching late, or cramped?
- Contact point: Is contact in front and to the side, not behind the body?
- Swing path: Does the racket travel through the ball, or stop/chop?
- Follow-through: Does the body finish naturally, or does the arm stop alone?
- Footwork: Is the player waiting flat-footed, crossing awkwardly, or recovering?
- Balance: Does weight move through the shot, or fall backward/sideways?

For beginners, do not list all issues. Choose one main issue and one supporting cue.

## Kinetic Chain Analysis

Use `references/biomechanics-checklist.md` when writing this section. The report should identify the first visible break in the chain:

1. Feet and spacing
2. Leg/hip loading
3. Trunk and shoulder turn
4. Arm path and racket lag/release
5. Contact window
6. Follow-through and recovery

Examples:

- If the player arrives late, do not over-focus on wrist/racket face. The first break is footwork and spacing.
- If the feet arrive but the shoulders never turn, the first break is unit turn/trunk.
- If the body loads well but the arm stops after contact, the break is swing path/follow-through.
- If the finish is good but the next ball rushes the player, the break is recovery timing.

In `kinetic_chain.segments`, use `good`, `watch`, `fix`, or `unknown`. Mark a segment `unknown` when the camera cannot show it.

## Beginner Backhand Checks

- Preparation: racket and shoulder turn before the bounce.
- Grip/hand support: for two-handed backhand, both hands guide the racket.
- Contact: contact slightly in front, not jammed near the body.
- Rotation: shoulders turn and then unwind; avoid pure arm swing.
- Finish: racket finishes toward the target, body remains balanced.

## Beginner Serve Checks

Only analyze serve when the video clearly shows the full body and toss:

- Toss consistency and height.
- Trophy position: elbow, racket, shoulder tilt.
- Weight transfer and knee bend.
- Contact reach: contact high and in front.
- Follow-through and landing balance.

If the camera misses the toss/contact, say the serve diagnosis is low-confidence.

## Report Logic

Each issue should have:

- "看到什么": visible evidence from one frame or sequence.
- "为什么影响你": plain-language consequence.
- "下次口令": one short cue the player can remember.
- "练习": one drill for 3-5 minutes or 20-30 balls.

Mechanics-heavy reports should also include:

- `stroke_analysis`: phase-by-phase observations tied to frames/clips.
- `kinetic_chain`: body-segment sequence and first visible break.
- `evidence_frames`: 2-4 claim-to-frame links.
- `confidence_notes`: explicit camera and evidence limits.

Good beginner cues:

- "球一出来，先转肩。"
- "拍子先到右后方，再等球。"
- "先找位置，再挥拍。"
- "打完让拍子自然过去，不要急着收。"

## Copy Style

Use warm, specific language:

- "这拍值得夸：身体不是停住挥手，而是真的跟着拍子转过去了。"
- "问题不在你不会发力，而是准备晚了半拍。"
- "先别同时改三件事，下一次只抓一个点。"

Avoid generic AI language:

- "动作协调性有待提高。"
- "建议加强核心力量。"
- "整体表现不错。"

## Confidence Notes

Mention uncertainty when:

- the player is small in frame,
- the racket/ball is blurred,
- the camera angle hides contact,
- the video is too low frame-rate,
- the important phase is outside the frame.
